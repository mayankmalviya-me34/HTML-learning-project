                <h3>Masala dosa</h3>
                <p>Think of it as southern India's take on a pancake, except that it's thin like a crêpe and typically served with savory fillings. Unlike flour pancakes, dosa batter is made from fermented lentils and rice, producing a crispy exterior and a softer interior. One origin story to explain the source of the name (dosha means to sin) tells of a Brahmin cook who was experimenting with fermented rice and ended up with an altogether different product than the alcohol he was secretly trying to make. You'll be happy to skip the rice wine once you get a bite of this versatile snack.

                    The variations are abundant, and popular fillings include onions, potato, chutney, coconut, and fresh coriander. As for masala dosa, which is commonly eaten in Mysore, you'll generally find it either stuffed with potato curry and butter or with an assortment of chutneys, including tomato, mint, and coconut. The result is perfect to temporarily satiate your appetite at any time of the day, and it's even gluten-free. Plus, thanks to the fermentation process, you can expect some gut-friendly bacteria in your meal, according to Indian Mirror.
